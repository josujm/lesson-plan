                It rained heavily all night. The sunlight was a little pale. <br/>
                Teddy, a young boy of ten, ran out into the garden.<br/>
                He saw a mongoose lying wet and still on the grass.<br/>
                'Here's a dead mongoose,'' Teddy called out to his mother.
                Let's bury him.
