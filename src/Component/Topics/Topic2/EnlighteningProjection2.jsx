                'No,'' said Teddy's mother.<br /> 'His heart is beating
                faintly.<br /> Perhaps he will live.<br />
                Let's take him inside and dry him.<br />''
                Teddy's father wrapped him up in an old woollen muffler and placed him near the fire.<br />
                The mangoose sneezed.<br /> Teddy and his parents were delighted.
                <br />They gave him some meat and then took him outside.
                <br />He sat in the sunlight and shook his fur till it was quite dry.
                <br /> He then shook his long fluffy tail till it looked like bottle brush.
