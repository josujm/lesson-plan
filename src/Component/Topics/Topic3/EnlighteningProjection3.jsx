                In the morning, he came for breakfast sitting on Teddy's shoulder.<br /> Teddy gave him a banana and a boiled egg. <br />The mongoose enjoyed the breakfast.<br />
                Soon Teddy and the little mongoose became good friends.<br /> The mongoose ran through the tall grass crying 'Rikky-tikk-tikki-tikki-tikk'. <br />Teddy used to laugh at him and started calling him Rikki Tikki Tawi.<br />
                One morning Rikki Tikki was wandering about in the garden.<br /> There he saw Nag, the big cobra and his wife, Nagina. <br />Cobra and mongoose are age-old enemies.<br /> Although Rikki Tikki was young, he knew that the main objective of a mongoose's life is to fight and kill the snakes.<br />
