                It was night.<br /> Teddy carried Rikki to bed. <br />As soon as the boy was asleep Rikki went off for his nightly walk round the house.<br /> Suddenly the silence was disturbed by a faint noise.<br /> It came from the bathroom of Teddy's parents.<br />
                Rikki-Tikki quickly entered the bathroom. He could hear Nag and Nagina talking on the other side of the bathroom drain.</p>
